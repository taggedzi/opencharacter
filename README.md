This is NOT the official opencharacter project.  

I attempted to modify the original official project to get it to work on a local system for development, demo, and/or testing. My recomendation is simply. Don't.

I am leaving the FORK here because I wanted to leave a trail of what was required to make it work on a local system. Even after these changes it is not fully functional with Ollama, that is what I was working on when I stopped and decided to move on.

This project is tightly coupled with Cloudflare... and separating the two pretty much requires disabling/bypassing and altering a decent amount of code. Which I did.

Even after separating them, I was not impressed with this projects capabilities. And was very disturbed when I saw an ad being served to me running from my local server with a local LLM.  

TLDR.
If you want to run this locally or on a different service... I wish you the best of luck, feel free to see my changes to give you a start, but my changes WILL NOT be suitable for a production environment. 

DO NOT use this fork in a production environment please refer to the original project. This fork was intended to make a development/demo version to see if I liked the project, it is not to be used by the public in any way.  You have been warned.
