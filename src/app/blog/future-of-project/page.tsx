                    In this writing I want to outline where I think this project is going and how I plan to grow it a sustainable manner. 
                    First a bit of background on the project, I started this project mainly for two reasons.

                    I was building a lot with Backend as a service providers and wanted to try something new. Secondly, I saw on Reddit r/CharacterAI shutting down the 
                    old site and users constantly complaining about the filters and censorship.

                <p className='text-sm leading-7'>
                    They even made multiple subreddits (with 10K+ users) to rebel against the new rules. I then looked around and saw their was a lot of alternatives 
                    that built a nice UI and monetized very early, so low rate limits, ads, bombarding users with subscriptions or it was VC funded projects that just 
                    maxed out on user growth with no paid plans and there was no open source project.

                    <li>Make it profitable so don{"'"}t have to compromise on censorship, filters pressures from external groups (investors, payment providers, etc)</li>

                    <li>Bring in every prominent AI API/service to the platform and give creators all the tools and freedoms to create whatever they want</li>

                    Should be extremely easy.
